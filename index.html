Here is an example of a 200-word summary of the first chapter of the novel "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien:

Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who lives in a comfortable hole in the ground. One day, the wizard Gandalf comes to his door and invites him on an adventure to reclaim a lost treasure from Smaug the dragon. Bilbo is reluctant at first, but he eventually agrees to go. The dwarves who are also on the quest are a rowdy and quarrelsome group, but Bilbo soon finds himself bonding with them. They set out on their journey, facing many dangers along the way. In the end, they are successful in defeating Smaug and reclaiming the treasure.
